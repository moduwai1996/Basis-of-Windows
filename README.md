# Learning Diary 1 - BYOD & Basics of Windows

The purpose of this assignment is to set up your personal devices for educational purposes (HAMK BYOD), get familiar with different tools such vcommander, VDI and to understand the basics of computing.

## How to work on the learning portfolio? 

- Make sure you use Markdown for all your tasks. While you're working on tasks for your learning portfolio, you'll also get better at using Markdown.

- You will update the file ```lp1.md``` by providing answers as asked. 

- Try to work on tasks regularly. Doing tasks consistently on regular basis will affect your final grade. It's better to work on tasks steadily throughout the course, rather than waiting until the last minute before things are due. This will help you learn better and get better results.
